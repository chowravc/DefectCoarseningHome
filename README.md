A demonstration notebook for the detection of topological defects can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/chowravc/YOLOv5DefectDetection/blob/main/YOLOv5_Defect_Detection_Notebook.ipynb).

Trained weights for a YOLOv5s model can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n8J3UyySrCJJs2r-JgYiLG0yXeB5yhJg/view?usp=sharing).

Repository with data processing pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/chowravc/Process_YOLOv5_defects_With_Orientation).
